                    <p class="text">Road often belongs nowhere. Thus, I define that road is space in-between and vulnerable since it is not destination but process. With the
                        maps which depict three important places in my life, I made frame by cutting all the places out except the roads. Collaging three map frames
                        eventually creates one space. This work shows that when all the process, which is represented by road, comes together, it creates explicit
                        space. Thus, road and process should be regarded as a one important place in our lives even though it seems trivial and unimportant. </p>
